# Trees

Implementation of binary tree and binary search tree.

## Challenge

Implement a binary tree class with associated methods for data collection manipulation. It should include methods for each of the three depth-first traversals: pre-order, in-order, post-order.

Implement a binary search tree as a subclass of the binary tree, with an Add and Contains method.

## Approach and Efficiency

Approach explanation

Efficiency of methods is as follows:

## API

### Binary Tree

* `BinaryTree()` - Instantiate a new Binary Tree

### Binary Search Tree

* `BinarySearchTree()` - Instantiate a new Binary Search Tree
